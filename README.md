# Lemons-Landing-Page
This is a landing page of an hypothetical site called "Lemons".

I created this as a self issued 7 days challenge to create a website page using Grid for the first time (+ no Flexbox).

Disclaimer: This site is NOT mobile friendly or optimized in almost no way
       The smallest it's able to resize retaining any likely-looking shape is to around Tablet size (~768px * ~842px).

(Dates may be weird in relation to the 7 days time frame i wrote about.

 The reason being i've had to modify/swap images to copyright free images as i didnt take into account publishing here at the time of creating.
 
 Also renaming classes and such so they'd make sense.)
